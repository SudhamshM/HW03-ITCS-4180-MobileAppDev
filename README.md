In this assignment you will get familiar with Android Fragments, and data passing 
between activity and fragments. You will build a multiple activity Blood Alcohol Content 
(BAC) Level Calculator application.

This app is composed of one activity (Main Activity) and multiple fragments namely the 
BAC Calculator, Set Profile, Add Drink and View Drinks. The app requirements are as 
follows:
1. Create a Drink class. An ArrayList of Drink objects should be stored in the Main 
Activity to maintain the list of user added drinks.
2. All communication between fragments should be performed through the Main Activity.
3. When the Main Activity starts it should load the “BAC Calculator” Fragment as the 
initial fragment.
